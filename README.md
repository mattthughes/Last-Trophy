## Design Plane

### Color Palette

This is the Color Palette I decided to go with, there are five colours of choice red will be used for the errors on the application and delete buttons, while the green will be used for any login or sign up buttons. There will also be a blue colour that is used for upvoting other user guides. While the white will be used for the background the application has a very simplistic look to not take away any attention from the content on the application.
